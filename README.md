# leaving betastar

**when I refer to "we", I mean Zastix and I.**

Xotic has fucked me over multiple times.
- Hacked my friends' guilded/discord accounts to leak their dms, all the while he harasses me over what I said to them
- Frauded Zastix's PayPal out of $100
- Sent me unsolicited pornography after I told him my kinks
- Never listened to anything I asked him to do that would help him
- Threatened to doxx me, leak my IP, come to my house and shoot me
- Manipulated and extorted me out of my intentionally broken "exploits"

And he still doesn't know why we did this, after I told him multiple times.

## **"If Zastix is leaving, I'm leaving too."**
This is a hard one. Zastix originally said he would finish the spammer with me, but is no longer going to, and I will have to continue it by myself.  
Unfortunately, I don't know how to work on the backend for the spammer, so I won't work on it either.
So, I will work with him on releasing the full, incomplete, and broken source code instead.  

After all this shit happened, Zastix decided to leave, and I will be deleting my website, all my Replit repositories, and all my GitHub repositories except this one.  
Thank you guys for all your support ðŸ¤—

## **"wtf happened???"**
After I told Zastix what happened, we started to abuse exploits on the server.  
Xotic told me that he would patch all of these, yet he didn't and he just gaslighted me again. He restricted /run command permissions to himself.

**Command syntax**  
To run unsafe code on other's browsers, just execute this, but replace (name) and (code) with, of course, the person's name and the code you want to execute:  

```/run->(name)->(code)```

**Announcement exploits**  
Okay, so this is a funny one.  
There's an exploit that we abused to log EVERYONE's session IDs, that we could use to bump them up to \#3 on the leaderboard! (We did this with D13alt)

```/announce->Close this-><img src="h" onerror="(zastix's secret code, not supposed to release)">```

This runs unsafe code on everyone's browsers! A Tampermonkey script to patch this exploit will be released shortly after I finish this documentation.

Aside from commands, we also did other stuff as well.

- Wrote a userbot to ban a small portion of people on the Betastar Discord server.
    - Xotic then threatened to doxx me, come to my house and shoot me, etc. over it because I encouraged Zastix to do it.

## **the xotic doxx**
Xotic threatened to doxx me, shoot me and ddos me, so basically Zastix gave his IP to me, spreaded his doxx everywhere he could, and made jokes about it.

Here's a HILARIOUS small portion of that doxx.

```
Hes dumb as fuck he has 3.0 GPA LOL!
```

LMFAO ðŸ˜‚

Anyways, that's all for the xotic doxx. Let's move on to what we'll be doing next.

## **what we'll be doing next**
We'll stay close friends, but we won't do anything else for Betastar/blax.  

This is really, REALLY fucking sad, because I loved working on the spammer. Whatever. Might release it as a CSS library ðŸ˜‚.  
The UI is SUPER good, though.  
Zastix asked me to make it look like the spamis.fun gui after an update, and after hours and hours he loved it and I felt so happy ðŸ˜€.  
Now all of it is over, and we won't be working on it.
